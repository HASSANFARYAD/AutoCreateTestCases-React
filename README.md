## React Project with Automated Component and Test Generation
Welcome to the React project repository! This project is set up with a powerful code generation tool called Plop. With Plop, you can easily create new components along with their corresponding test files automatically. This ensures consistency across your codebase and saves you time.

## Features
- Automated Component Creation: Quickly scaffold new React components.
- Automatic Test File Generation: Each new component comes with a pre-configured test file.
- Consistency and Efficiency: Standardized component and test structure to maintain code quality and speed up development.

## Getting Started
- Follow these instructions to get the project up and running on your local machine.

## Prerequisites
- Make sure you have Node.js and npm installed. You can download them from nodejs.org.

## Installation
- Clone the repository:


## Install the dependencies:
### `npm install`

## Generate a New Component and Test File:

This project uses Plop to streamline the creation of new components and their corresponding test files.

## To generate a new component, run:

### `npx plop component`

You will be prompted to enter the name of the new component. Plop will then create the following files in the src/components directory:

ComponentName/ComponentName.js: The new React component.
ComponentName/ComponentName.test.js: The Jest test file for the new component.
Running Tests:

After generating a new component and its test file, you can run the tests using:

npm test
